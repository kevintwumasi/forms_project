HEALTH AND FITNESS APP (HFA) V0.1

--- for demo 2 --- 
create a 'bin' directory in the root folder
to run the terminal interface, run 'javac \*.java -d ../bin' in the following order of folders:
Structs, Data, Calc, Menu

to run the program, cd into bin on the root folder, then run 'java Main'

to compile the documentation, run 'pdflatex Documentation.tex' in the Docs folder. should generate a .pdf (WIP)

the gui has not been linked to the program, so it is still a standalone interface. to compile, simply run 'javac \*.java && java GUI' in the GUI folder.
--- end note ---

The intention of this application is to give users valuable insights and data regarding their health and fitness.

CURRENT FEATURES:

HFA will accept the following data about user:

    Gender
    Height
    Weight
    Body Fat%
    Activity Level
    Resting BPM
    Lifting data

Based on the above inputs, HFA will present the following stats:

Body Mass Index - BMI is a general calculation used to assess a person's general level of weight normalcy. This metric is most relevant for people who do not lift weights or exercise a lot, and is a good standard for most people to assess whether an individual is underweight, overweight, or at a reccomended level.

The BMI formula is BMI = Kg / m^2. Here are the standard BMI ranges.

Weight Category BMI Underweight Below 18.5 Normal 18.524.9 Overweight 25.029.9 Obesity 30.0 and Above

Fat Free Mass Index - Similar to BMI, FFMI takes muscle mass into account. Those with a high amount of lean muscle mass, such as bodybuilders, would find themselves very overweight in a BMI calculation. The FFMI takes body fat into account. This metric is also used to assess whether competitors are synthetically enhanced, as scores above 25 are nearly impossible to achieve naturally.

FFMI calculation:

Total Body Fat = Weight in Kg * (body fat % / 100) Lean Weight = Weight in Kg * (1 - (body fat % / 100) FFMI = (Lean Weight in Kg / 2.2)/ ((Feet * 12.0 + Inches) * 0.0254)^2 Adjusted FFMI = FFMI + ( 6.3 * (1.8 - (Feet * 12.0 + Inches) * 0.0254))

VO2 max - This is a measure of the volume of oxygen that is used by your body to convert energy. The metric is the maximum rate that an individual can achieve. This is often calculated for atheletes who do very intense cardio such as runners and cyclists. Although it is usually tested in a sophisticated lab, there are fairly accurate calculations that can be performed based on resting BPM and Age.

Standards:

A+ "Superior" A "Excellent" B "Good" C "Fair" D "Poor"

Age D C B A A+ 20 - 29 <= 41 42 - 45 46 - 50 51 - 55 56+ 30 - 39 <= 40 41 - 43 44 - 47 48 - 53 54+ 40 - 49 <= 37 38 - 41 42 - 45 46 - 52 53+ 50 - 59 <= 34 35 - 37 38 - 42 43 - 49 50+ 60 - 69 <= 30 31 - 34 35 - 38 39 - 45 46+ 70 - 79 <= 27 28 - 30 31 - 35 36 - 41 42+

Strength Standards - Currently HFA can give you insights based on your 1-rep max bench press. Your lift will be compared against data from millions of other lifters, and a percentile will be calculated to give you an idea of where you stand amongst others of similar gender, weight, etc.

GUI:

The GUI as of Demo 2 consists of the majority of the screens that a user will be able to go through by the end of this project. It currently prompts users to select between new user or current user. A proposed menu for login will be discussed for implementation in future versions. Currently the data inputs aren't implemented in any widgets/buttons but will be functioning in future versions.
Merging the calculations and various other classes will be implemented later on.
